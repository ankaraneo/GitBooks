# How to Count your Macros

<br>

In this chapter we will be covering *how* to count your macros. You should have already calculated your daily requirements, and now we will dwelve into how to actually meet those requirements.

There are a few items you are going to need. The first is a food scale, because in order to know the nutritional content of something, we first need to know how much it weighs. The second is a food tracking app which there are a plethora of. A few that I suggest are MyFitnessPal, LoseIt, and FitDay. I personally favor MyFitnessPal but feel free to experiment with each and see which one you like best.

Whenever tracking your macronutrients, **precision** is key. It is very important for you to make sure you are hitting your assigned macro targets to gaurntee steady and consistent progress. Make sure you use a digital food scale and whenever possible have control over how your food has been prepared.

### Weighing and Tracking

Whenever tracking your food, track it by *weight*, not *volume*. Some items will only have the volume of the serving size instead of including the seving size in weight. However, ALWAYS weigh it out. For example, a half-cup of oats is supposed to be 40 grams, but many times a half-cup will end up weighing more. So remember, when it doubt weight it out!

Whenever weighing meat and vegetables, always weigh them **raw**, and before you have cooked them.

### Logging Foods

While you are weighing your foods, you are going to either log it in the app of your choice at that moment, or write it down so you can remember it later. These food diary applications will contain huge databases of just about every type of food that you will eat. When you go to log your food, you can search in the database the name of the food and what brand it is, or you can scan the barcode on the package and it will automatically search it for you. Then, after it pulls up the correctly matching food, you can log it into your diary, and it will automatically add up everything you have eaten today, and what you have left. It is generally a good idea to make sure the nutritional value of the food that you logged matches the nutritional value on the food's package. Even though the names might be identical, the nutritional value might contain some errors. If you do find an error, keep searching for a more accurate version or you can add it yourself.

These applications will add up everything you have eaten for today, and output how many calories, grams of fat, protein, carbohydrates, and all of your micronutrients that you have eaten. It will also show you how much left you have for that day. Nice and easy huh!?

### Foods without barcodes or nutritional values

Some foods you come accross won't have the nutritional value printed on the packages. This can be a big nusence, but there is a way to make it easier.

In this case, you will have to download a USDA nutrition application, or there are a few websites that serve the same purpose. The best I have come accross are Calorieking.com and Nutritiondata.self.com. These websites also run off of the USDA nutrition database, and will make it easier to find the nutritional content of foods with out a label. They can be very hard to navigate at times due to the way you have to search for foods, but as you continue to use the USDA nutrition database it will become easier for you to navigate.

For example, say you bought a box of very soft chocolate-chip cookies from your local supermarket. However, since it was in the bakery they don't have the nutritional value on the package. Well thanks to our handy-dandy USDA database we can search for them! It's going to be a little tricky though and the completed search will look like this: Cookies, chocolate-chip, commercialy prepared, soft-type.

Basically, whenever searching for a food you must think of it in incremental steps. In this case, our first step is to think of what exactly are we looking for? Our answer is a cookie. Ok, what kind of cookie? Chocolate-chip. Was it commercially prepared, or made from a recipe? These both would technically be correct in this case, but it will be up to you to decide the best choice for that particular instance. For this example we will pick commercially prepared. Ok, now we have a list of difference kinds of commercially prepared cookies, such as higher fat, low fat, enriched (with vitamins & minerals), unenriched, soft-type, or a special dietary type of cookie. Well, if we recall we bought a box of "very soft chocolate-chip cookies", so thus we would pick the soft-type.

Then, for whatever your end result is, it will give you the different ways of measuring your nutritional content. In this case, we will either have the choice of viewing the nutrition by 1 ounce, 100 grams, or "1 cookie". Since 1 cookie is by *volume* we don't want to do that because it can vary by tremendous amounts. Instead, we will pick either 100 grams or 1 ounce (this is personal preference). Then weigh your cookie to find the weight, and log it into your food diary app.

This will be the most accurate way for you to determine the nutritional content of foods that don't have a nutrition label on them. This technique can also be used for eating out and at social events. However, this should be done sparingly. Again, it is all about maintaining a balance within your life. Your diet should not dictate your life, but you should not compromise your goals based on your lifestyle either.

The longer you track your foods and understand exactly what kind of nutritional content is in different things, it will be much easier to determine the nutritional value of foods that you don't have a nutrition label for. This just comes with practice, and will allow you to be more precise when you are in conditions where you don't have full control over how your foods are being prepared.
