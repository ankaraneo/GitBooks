# How to Count your Macros

<br>

In this chapter we will be covering *how* to count your macros. You should have already calculated your daily requirements, and now we will dwelve into how to actually meet those requirements.

There are a few items you are going to need. The first is a food scale, because in order to know the nutritional content of something, we first need to know how much it weighs. The second is a food tracking app which there are a plethora of. A few that I suggest are MyFitnessPal, LoseIt, and FitDay. I personally favor MyFitnessPal but feel free to experiment with each and see which one you like best.

Whenever tracking your macronutrients, **precision** is key. It is very important for you to make sure you are hitting your assigned macro targets to gaurntee steady and consistent progress. Make sure you use a digital food scale and whenever possible have control over your food.
