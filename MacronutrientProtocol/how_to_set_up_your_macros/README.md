# How to Set up Your Macros

<br>

So we've learned why following a rigid dieting approach is unhealthy and should be avoided, how we lose/gain weight, and what Flexible Dieting is. Now you may be wondering "Well how do I set up my macros?!". Worry no more, you've come to the right chapter!

Let's take example person, Johnny Dude, and he is going to set up his macros. A good general rule to follow when determing caloric intake is to multiply your body weight by a number between 14-16. If you have a slow metabolism, carrying a little bit more weight, or are a women, you would multiply by 14. If you are leaner, have a faster metabolism, very active, or a male, you would multiply by 15.

If your goal is to lose weight, you would then subtract 15-20% from your caloric intake. This will put you into a caloric deficit. If you are wanting to gain weight, you would add 8-12% to your caloric intake. This will put you into a caloric surplus. If you are just wanting to maintain, then keep your intake the same.

It is reccommended that if you don't know where your maintence calorie level is, or are just getting started, then eat at your estimated maintnence level for one week. This will allow you to see how your weight responds to this caloric intake. If you gain weight, then you are too high and should remove calories. If you lose weight, then you are too low and should add in calories. You would then do this until your weight is stable, and then you are left with your maintnence caloric intake. When adjusting your caloric intake, only add or subtract anywhere from 40-80 calories at a time. 60 calories is generally a good medium that is not too agressive or too low.

So now you have your caloric intake, but we want to break this down further. First, we are going to set our fat and protein requirements. A good rule of thumb is to set fat between 20-30% of total calories. Then we want to get our protein requirements. You're protein intake while dieting is going to vary based on your level of leaness, your carbohydrate intake, and/or how deep you are into a diet. The leaner you are, the fewer carbohydrates you are eating, or the deeper you are into a diet, the higher your protein requirements will be in order to preserve muscle mass. This leaves us with a range from 1.2-1.5 g/lb of body weight, or anything higher than 2.7-3.2 g/kg of lean body mass.

Lastly, we want to calculate how many carbohydrates we will be eating. We should now have our daily caloric intake, and the amount of fat and protein we will be eating. You are then going to add up the amount of fat calories, and protein calories to see how many calories that leaves us from carbohydrates. Since carbohydrates are not essential to our bodies, we can theoretically live without them, however, they play an important role in muscle preservation, thyroid regulation, and regulating different hormones, so it is better to include them in our diet. Also, they help keep balance in our diet and allow us to eat a variety of foods.

After adding up your calories used so far, you will want to subtract that from you daily calorie intake. This will leave you with the remaining calories. Since carbohydrates have four calories per gram, divide the remaining calories by four and this will give you the grams of carbohydrates that you will be eating. Then you're finished! You'll want to make sure you are meeting your macronutrient goals every day. A lot of people get confused on whether you should try to meet your calorie goal, or focus on macronutrients. Well, always focus on your macronutrient goals first, then if you hit them, you will meet your caloric intake goal.

Johnny is 160 pounds, and isn't really sure what to multiply by, so he is just going to go down the middle and pick 15.
