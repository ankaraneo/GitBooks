# Macronutrients

<br>

Every time you eat something, you are consuming macronutrients. Nothing more fats, carbs, protein. Just about every food will have all three of them, hence macro. Marconutients, or marcos, are what make up your caloric intake. Fats 9cals, carbs and protein 4cals. Say you eat a 200 calories granola bar. These calories come from the macros that are present in them. For example, lets say the granola bar has 8 fat, 7 protein, and 25 carbs. This equals 200 calories.

On the other hand, we have micronutrients. As you might have guessed, they are your vitamins and minerals. Some examples of minerals are calcium, potassium, and sodium. Vitamin examples are A, D, & K. Micronutrients are **very** important for our bodies, and they help regulate and contorl different bodily functions. The closer we are to having an adequate intake of them, the more it help our body run these bodily functions. It will make them more effiecient, and help prevent any health problems later on down the road.
