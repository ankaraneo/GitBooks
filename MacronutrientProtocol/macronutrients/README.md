# Macronutrients

<br>

Every time you eat something, you are consuming macronutrients. Nothing more fats, carbs, protein. Just about every food will have all three of them, hence macro. Marconutients, or marcos, are what make up your caloric intake. Fats 9cals, carbs and protein 4cals. Say you eat a 200 calories granola bar. These calories come from the macros that are present in them. For example, lets say the granola bar has 8 fat, 7 protein, and 25 carbs. This equals 200 calories.

On the other hand, we have micronutrients. As you might have guessed, they are your vitamins and minerals. Some examples of minerals are calcium, potassium, and sodium. Vitamin examples are A, D, & K. Micronutrients are **very** important for our bodies, and they help regulate and contorl different bodily functions. The closer we are to having an adequate intake of them, the more it help our body run these bodily functions. It will make them more effiecient, and help prevent any health problems later on down the road.

Regardless of your diet approach, you should ALWAYS be tracking your macronutrients. Keeping track of your macros is just a way for one to be precise when pursuing their personal fitness goals. Not tracking your macros will lead to a lot of guessing as to why something isn't working, or if things aren't going according to plan.

For example, take two chefs and we will have them run a little experiment. Both chefs will be following the exact same recipe, however chef A is going to have the exact measurements for the recipe, and chef B will be doing it off the top of his head. They both are expected to make the dish come out to enough food for 15 people. Chef A is going to be precise with his measurements, and will be practicaly gaurnteed the outcome that his dish will feed 15 people. Chef B on the other hand will have a lot of confusion as to exactly how much he needs, and there will be lots of guessing, which may result in a dish size that does not meet the requirements.

Tracking your macronutrients is exactly the same. It takes out the guessing game of why things aren't going according to plan. Ever tried to diet down, but you weren't losing as much weight as you expected? Or maybe you weren't losing weight at all? This is why tracking macros are vital to accurately meeting ones personal fitness goals.
