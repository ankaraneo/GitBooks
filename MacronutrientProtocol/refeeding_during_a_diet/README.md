# Refeeding During a Diet

<br>

### Cheat Meals vs. Refeeds
Structured refeeding is the process of increasing your caloric intake for a day while dieting. This allows for mostly psychological benefiet, but will help improve training performance, and libido.

I'm sure you're aware of the infamous 'cheat meal', which some one uses to "reward" themselves for sticking to thier diet. However, a structured refeed is different, and is essentially the cheat meal 2.0 version with new improvements and cuts out all the harmful side effects. There is quite a big difference between the two:

* Cheat meals are typically a meal outside of a diet regime that completely disregards macronutrient composition. Cheat meals can very easily snowball into a complete binge usually consist of high fat foods (due to fat restriction in one's diet) and can very easily ruin progress.
* Refeeds are a structured raise in calories within one's diet regime. The raise in calories comes primarily from carbohydrates, which will be stored as glycogen that be utilized during training and will help increase performance. Since carbohydrates are not stored directly in fat cells, this will allow dieters to fix whatever cravings they may have, increase performace, and continue on with their fat loss goals.

Dietary fat is very easily stored within fat cells (around 90% efficiency) regardless of whether you are dieting or in a caloric surplus. When one consumes a cheat meal (usually high in fat) with total disregard for macronutrient composition, this can very easily lead to fat gain. Not directly because it is high in fat, but it will usually contain a substantial amount of calories which will put someone way over their maintence caloric intake, and lead to a significant amount of fat gain.

A STRUCTURED refeed is an increase in calories primarily from carboydrates that will allow a dieter to fix any cravings they may have, all while increasing training performace, and not hindering one's fat loss goals.
