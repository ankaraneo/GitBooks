# The Value of Science

<br>

I want to give you a heads up that this book will be shattering a lot of myths that you might have previously thought were true. There is nothing wrong with having believed in false claims. You were most likely just misled, and/or have never even been informed about the current scientific evidence surrounding the fitness industry. We all learn new things, some later than others, and that's part of growing as a person. Being able to change your beliefs based on the evidence presented to you is part of expanding your bubble of knowledge. So dont feel ashamed or guilty BY ANY MEANS when you stumble upon things in this book that you once thought were true, but are actually false. You should be ashamed of yourself however, when you are presented with all the scientific evidence regarding a topic, and you choose to refuse the validity of the conclusion that these studies make. There is a difference between investigating evidence to make sure it was accurately done, and refusing to accept the conclusion beacuse it doesn't line up with how you previously thought things worked. If you find yourself in the latter, then no one but yourself can help you. If you don't value scientific evidence, then on what basis can you present an argument?
