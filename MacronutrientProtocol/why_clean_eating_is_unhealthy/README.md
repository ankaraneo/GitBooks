# Why Clean Eating is Unhealthy

<br>

### What does it mean to be healthy? - Physical & mental health //TODO

The leading myth in today's fitness industry.... The notion that you must eat 'clean' foods to get your desired results. It's EVERYWHERE, and the sad part is majority of people think it's the only way to produce results. Not only is it not the only way, it's severely unhealthy. How many times have you tried to diet, maybe stuck with it for a period of time, then inevitably you either binged or fell back into your previous eating habits? If not you, then how many times have you heard someone say they "ate like crap this past weekend." Majority of people associate falling off a diet, or "cheating", as just a lack of will. Not only is this a ridiculous judgement, this cyclical dieting is DANGEROUS. Many people view "cheating" as just a slip-up and brush it under the rug. What they don't realize is the very serious side effects that this has on their bodies. Some people combat over eating with excessive calorie restriction and increased exercise. This is now recognized as an eating disorder by the National Eating Disorder Association, by the name of Orthorexia Nervosa. It is litterally defined as having a "fixation on righteous eating." Dr. Karin Katrina wrote a brief article that can be found on at the [Orthorexia Nervosa](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/orthorexia-nervosa) page, on nationaleatingdisorder.org.

Here is an exerpt from that article:

<blockquote>
Orthorexia starts out as an innocent attempt to eat more healthfully, but orthorexics become fixated on food quality and purity.  They become consumed with what and how much to eat, and how to deal with “slip-ups.”  An iron-clad will is needed to maintain this rigid eating style.  Every day is a chance to eat right, be “good,” rise above others in dietary prowess, and self-punish if temptation wins (usually through stricter eating, fasts and exercise).  Self-esteem becomes wrapped up in the purity of orthorexics’ diet and they sometimes feel superior to others, especially in regard to food intake.

Eventually food choices become so restrictive, in both variety and calories, that health suffers – an ironic twist for a person so completely dedicated to healthy eating.  Eventually, the obsession with healthy eating can crowd out other activities and interests, impair relationships, and become physically dangerous.

### The inevitable Binge

Apart from rigid dieting being an eating disorder, I shouldn't have to explain how inevitable it is that a binge will occur. Whether or not a "cheat meal" can be considered a binge is on the border, but it's fairly close. The problem is that when you seperate foods into a "good" and a "bad" group, when this binge occurs, johnny appleseed [insert example person as to not make it direct] is going to go straight for all the foods in the "bad" group. Foods that are put into the "bad" group usually are calorically dense, and high in fat. Thus, binging on calorically dense foods makes it VERY easy to rack up thousands of calories which will cause a significant amount of fat gain.

When you are in a dieting phase, you're body is very prone to putting on fat if you over eat. Well, what happens when you overeat by a thousand calories possibly more? You guessed it, you get fatter. Your body is very efficient at storing the fat that we eat. Carbohydrates and protein are very rarely *actually* converted into fat. Well since the foods that johnny is eating are mostly high in fat, this fat will get stored in the body. The carbohydrates and protein will not nesicarrialy be stored as fat, but they prevent the oxidization of fat. This is the purpose of a controlled refeed, which we will get into later.

Just the notion that you have to "reward" yourself should already hint at an unhealthy relationship with food. As well as when somebody starts to consistently think about their diet and "staying on track", that is a clear cut sign that there is an improper balance in that person's life. Your diet should NEVER *dictate* your life just because you want to look a particular way. Your fitness goals should never come before your happiness in life. When your diet starts to get in the way of whether or not you can go out to eat with your friends and family, or get in the way of you being social at events with your friends, this should be a red flag that something needs to change.

### Nutrient Deficiencies - Studies

Apart from the inevitable binge, and unhealthy mentality of rigid dieting, restricting foods can lead to severe nutrient deficiencies. There was a study done by [xxxx] that watched a group of bodybuilders over the course of their diet going into a fitness show. What they found was that these people were very nutrient deficient in many categories. This includes calcium, Vitamin D [insert any others]. Since "clean" eating usually accompanies a lack of dairy in one's diet, it causes deficiencies in calcium, which is very important in regards to bone and muscle health, as well as [insert hormones]. Well, the accompanying Vitamin D deficiency renders whatever calcium that is being eaten useless, because Vitamin D allows for the uptake of calcium in the body.

### Rigid Dieting vs. Flexible Dieting - Studies

This is where flexible dieting comes in. The holy grail to these problems faced by those trying to diet. Flexible dieting is the process of enjoying the foods you love, all while achieving your fitness goals. Remember what we said about the first law of thermodynamics? Well, to further confirm the notion that *what* you eat does not play any significant role in your body composition, lets analyze a study performed by Bray GA, et al. Here is the title and abstract of this study:

<blockquote>

Title


Hormonal response to a fastfood meal.

</blockquote>


Participants experienced no difference in hormonal response when eating either a fast food meal, or an organic meal. This is the effect on BODY COMPOSITION. Chicken and vegetables are still HEALTHIER, but they have no effect on BODY COMPOSITION.

Assume we have two people intaking the exact same caloric intake, and macronutrient composition (i.e. 50g fat, 200c, & 150p). Person A consumes nothing but chicken, broccoli, asparagus, and a few other vegetables/food sources. Person B's diet comes from half healthier foods, and the other half he eats whatever he wants. There will be NO difference in the amount of weight lost by each individual. Why? Because *what* you eat has NO effect on BODY COMPOSITION. Yes, chicken and vegetables has more minerals and vitamins that M&Ms, but neither of these foods play a difference in how you lose weight. Remember, it's all about being in a negative energy balance, or a caloric deficit.
